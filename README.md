# piSense
## Introduction
This is a small project for developing a simple motion-activated activity tracker. The idea is to produce different types of output depending on the type (particularly frequency) of motion that is detected. Will also double as a security camera later on. In time I'll add some nice-looking reports.

## Materials
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 
- Raspberry Pi T-Cobbler (40 pins)
- 400 points breadboard
- 1x red LED
- 1x green LED (could also use one RGB LED)
- 2x 100 Ohm resistor
- 1x DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor
- 1x HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor
